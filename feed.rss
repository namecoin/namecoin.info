        <title>Electrum-NMC AppArmor, Static Analysis, and Input Validation + ncdns Unix Sockets</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Several new Electrum-NMC &amp;amp; ncdns enhancements have been added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;apparmor-profiles-for-electrum-nmc&quot;&gt;AppArmor Profiles for Electrum-NMC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AppArmor is a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system which confines programs to a limited set of resources. AppArmor confinement is provided via profiles loaded into the kernel.
By using AppArmor profiles, we can ensure that Electrum-NMC operates within a predefined security policy, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or malicious actions.
The profiles are provided in the contrib folder. For more information on AppArmor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/beginning-apparmor-profile-development#1-overview&quot;&gt;visit their website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;input-validation-in-electrum-nmcs-dns-builder-gui&quot;&gt;Input Validation in Electrum-NMC’s DNS Builder GUI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When passing data to the DNS Builder, certain validations are performed to offer hints and warnings about invalid data or outdated methods (such as algorithms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/screenshots/electrum-nmc/DNS-Builder-IP-Validation-2024.png&quot; alt=&quot;IP Validation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/screenshots/electrum-nmc/DNS-Builder-Algorithm-Validation-2024.png&quot; alt=&quot;IPFS Images&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;static-analysis-testing&quot;&gt;Static Analysis Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We run static analysis using tools such as Flake8, MyPy, and Pylint, comparing results with Electrum (Bitcoin version) to focus on Electrum-NMC-specific issues. This process, integrated into our CI, helps catch bugs early. Looking to contribute? Static analysis issues provide good first-time issues!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enabling-ncdns-to-perform-rpc-requests-via-unix-domain-sockets&quot;&gt;Enabling ncdns to Perform RPC Requests via Unix Domain Sockets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enabling ncdns to perform RPC requests via Unix domain sockets offers a more secure communication method than TCP/IP. To utilize a Unix domain socket, specify it in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;namecoinrpcaddress&lt;/code&gt; field as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;unix:// + &quot;your unix socket path&quot;&lt;/code&gt; such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;unix:///tmp/test.XXXX&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Namecoin Core supports only TCP/IP, we’ll redirect RPC requests from the Unix Socket to Namecoin Core. This can be achieved using a commnad such as socat command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;socat -d UNIX-LISTEN:&quot;my-unix-socket-path&quot;,fork TCP:&quot;host-address&quot;
socat -d UNIX-LISTEN:/tmp/test.XXXX,fork TCP:localhost:8332
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>rust-electrum-client for Namecoin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I needed to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/rust-electrum-client&quot;&gt;rust-electrum-client&lt;/a&gt; with Namecoin. I was kind of worried that this would be nontrivial, but as it turned out, I was able to get it working in just a few days of hacking, despite this being my first foray into Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main incompatibility that came up was that Namecoin headers have an AuxPoW header after the 80-byte Bitcoin-style header, and the deserialization functions in rust-electrum-client really didn’t like that trailing data. There were two deserialization functions that I had to patch to truncate the headers at 80 bytes, which got header parsing to work properly. My current patches are very unclean, and are not really suitable for publication, but I’m planning to clean them up and publish patches over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this was done, a few non-code workarounds were additionally needed (more on these later!), and I was then able to use a real-world rust-electrum-client application with Namecoin. I’ll talk more in a future post about what downstream code is using this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was funded by Cyphrs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Video, Slides, and Paper from Namecoin at GCER 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is a bit late, but I represented Namecoin at the 2022 Global Conference on Educational Robotics.  Although GCER doesn’t produce official recordings of their talks, I was able to obtain an amateur recording of my talk from an audience member.  I’ve also posted my slides, as well as my paper from the conference proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that, as this is an amateur recording, the audio quality is not spectacular.  It should also be noted that the audience is rather different from the audiences for whom I usually give Namecoin talks; as a result, the focus of the content is also rather different from my usual Namecoin talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/resources/presentations/GCER_2022/Namecoin_GCER_2022_Paper.pdf&quot;&gt;My paper is available here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to the staff and volunteers from KISS Institute for Practical Robotics, who organized GCER.  Also huge thanks to Helene Myers for the recording.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Enhancements to IPFS &amp; IPNS: A Closer Look at the Latest Updates</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Several new Electrum-NMC enhancements have been added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dedicated-gui-for-ipfs--ipns&quot;&gt;The Dedicated GUI for IPFS &amp;amp; IPNS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, interacting with IPFS required the creation of TXT records and knowledge of IPFS DNSLink. However, with the introduction of a dedicated GUI, users now have a more user-friendly option, available in the address tab. To learn more about DNSLink and its use of DNS TXT records to map names to IPFS addresses or IPNS names, refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/dnslink/&quot;&gt;IPFS DNS documentation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/screenshots/electrum-nmc/DNS-Builder-IPFS-2024-05-01.png&quot; alt=&quot;IPFS Images&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Demo video of Namecoin + IPFS in Brave.
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;added-option-for-value-encoding&quot;&gt;Added Option for Value Encoding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When registering names, there is now an option to pass values as binary, encoded in hexadecimal format. This enhancement provides greater flexibility and control for developers and power users, allowing them to represent domain name values in a more efficient and versatile manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/screenshots/electrum-nmc/Configure-Name-Dialog-Hex-2024-05-01.png&quot; alt=&quot;Binary Encoding (value)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gui-testing&quot;&gt;GUI Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For GUI testing, we validate the GUI form’s build process and execute regression tests, which helps us identify any errors in the files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;windows-binaries-testing&quot;&gt;Windows Binaries Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We validate the integrity of the build process and conduct regression tests on these binaries to ensure their functionality and detect any potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Namecoin will be at 37C3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After a lengthy pandemic-induced hiatus, C3 is finally back this year, and we’re happy to announce that three Namecoin developers will be at &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/wiki/index.php/Main_Page&quot;&gt;37C3 (the 37th Chaos Communication Congress)&lt;/a&gt; in Hamburg, December 27-30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excitingly, one of our developers in attendance (Hugo Landau) will be giving a talk in the main track (not a Cluster track); &lt;a href=&quot;https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2023/fahrplan/events/11781.html&quot;&gt;the details for that talk are here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect to give some additional talks and workshops at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://decentral.community/&quot;&gt;Critical Decentralization Cluster (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, however, the details of those events are still in flux and will probably not be announced until shortly before the beginning of the Congress; keep an eye on &lt;a href=&quot;https://frab.riat.at/en/37c3/public/schedule&quot;&gt;the CDC schedule&lt;/a&gt;. Recordings and live-streams may happen as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, Namecoin has participated in C3 as a Project of the Monero Assembly. We’re excited to announce that this year, Namecoin has been upgraded to a full Assembly of our own. Namecoin and Monero remain excellent friends, but everyone agreed that this year, the time was right for us to branch out as an independent Assembly. Also thanks go out to our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;https://replicant.us/&quot;&gt;The Replicant Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, who are once again facilitating Namecoin’s participation. We’re looking forward to the Congress!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Namecoin Receives 40.1k EUR in Additional Funding from NLnet Foundation’s NGI Assure Fund and European Commission</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re happy to announce that Namecoin is receiving 40,100 EUR (roughly 44,134 USD) in additional funding from &lt;a href=&quot;https://nlnet.nl/&quot;&gt;NLnet Foundation&lt;/a&gt;’s NGI Assure Fund.  If you’re unfamiliar with NLnet, you might want to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://nlnet.nl/foundation/&quot;&gt;about NLnet Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, or just take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://nlnet.nl/thema/index.html&quot;&gt;the projects they’ve funded over the years&lt;/a&gt; (you might see some familiar names).  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://nlnet.nl/assure/&quot;&gt;NGI Assure Fund&lt;/a&gt; is managed by NLnet and funded by the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, through their Next Generation Internet intitiative.  This new funding is focused on Electrum-NMC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use this funding to work on the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved sandboxing for better security.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved test coverage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved domain management GUI for better UX.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compact on-chain storage for better scalability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linux packaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work will principally be done by developers Robert Nganga and Jeremy Rand (who is the author of this post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d like to thank the awesome people at NLnet Foundation for the continued vote of confidence, as well as the European Commision for their support of a Next Generation Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be posting updates regularly as development proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Binary Encoding Support and Testing Enhancements</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Electrum-NMC has recently undergone significant improvements aimed at refining the user experience and expanding functionality. The most prominent changes involve the introduction of three distinct tabs within the graphical user interface (GUI): Hex, Domain, and ASCII. The Hex tab now serves as a dedicated space for users to interact with the hexadecimal representations of names, providing a standardized and transparent view of binary data. The Domain tab focuses on simplifying interactions by allowing users to employ a simpler format like “name.bit” instead of the original “d/name” format. Meanwhile, the ASCII tab preserves the original format of registration, ensuring compatibility for users who prefer the original format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;graceful-handling-of-invalid-ascii&quot;&gt;Graceful Handling of Invalid ASCII&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event of invalid ASCII input, the system gracefully handles the situation. This allows valid hexadecimal data that is not a valid ASCII representation to be managed without disrupting the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;appimage-binaries-testing&quot;&gt;AppImage Binaries Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dedicated testing pipeline has been introduced for AppImage binaries. The regression tests run on these binaries to verify their functionality and identify any potential issues. This meticulous approach ensures that users working with AppImage binaries can trust in the stability and performance of Electrum-NMC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;macos-tarball-binaries-testing&quot;&gt;MacOS Tarball Binaries Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For MacOS, a specific testing environment has been created to run regression tests on the tarball binaries. This testing setup not only verifies the integrity of the binaries but also ensures that Electrum-NMC performs seamlessly in a MacOS environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These testing procedures cover a range of scenarios and use cases, providing a robust framework to identify and address any potential issues before they impact end-users. The commitment to thorough testing underscores the project’s dedication to delivering a reliable and high-performance cryptocurrency wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was funded by NLnet Foundation’s NGI Assure Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SOCKSification: Outreachy Internship Progress</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;SOCKSification refers to the process of rerouting network traffic from an application via a SOCKS proxy server. This method is frequently used for security, anonymity, and circumventing network constraints. There are numerous techniques for SOCKSification, but in this article, we will focus on two main approaches that were considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first method includes intercepting the application’s connect and send system calls. When an application wants to connect to a remote server, it performs a connect system call with the target IP address and port specified. Following that, the send system call is used to transfer data through the established connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this method, we intercept the connect syscall and change the target IP address and port to those of the SOCKS proxy server. Then we intercept the send syscall which will contain a pointer (in tracee memory space) to the buffer that the application wants to send. We can prepend a SOCKS handshake to that buffer.  While this method can accomplish SOCKSification, it necessitates changing the tracee’s memory, which is not memory safe and might cause security problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second method, which is safer, includes utilizing the pidfd getfd capability, which was added to Linux v5.6, to duplicate the file descriptor of the established connection. When an application connects, the connect syscall returns a file descriptor, which may be used to transmit and receive data through the connection. We can replicate the file descriptor from the tracee to the tracer using the pidfd getfd functionality without having to touch the tracee’s memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To SOCKSify the program, we intercept the connect syscall and change the target IP address and port to those of the SOCKS proxy server. The exit of the connect syscall, which returns the file descriptor of the established socket, is then intercepted. Using pidfd getfd, we copy this file descriptor to the tracer and execute a SOCKS5 handshake with the tracer’s socket. After the handshake, we resume the tracee, and all future network traffic gets SOCKSified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOCKSification occurs in the function &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robertmin1/heteronculous-horklump/blob/test-3/main.go#L412&quot;&gt;Socksify.&lt;/a&gt; This function allows an application running on a Linux system to use the SOCKS5 protocol to route network traffic through a proxy server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function begins by checking whether the “one circuit” configuration option is set. If not, it initializes a set of authentication data consisting of 10 SOCKS user+pass pairs. Each connection is then assigned to a randomly selected slot from those 10. This is important in order to prevent vulnerability to a Sybil attack. Applications that connect to a P2P network (such as the Bitcoin network) may need to avoid using the same Tor circuit for all connections. Otherwise, a malicious Tor exit relay can block the application’s view of the network. Furthermore, using a different Tor circuit for each connection can also be helpful for things like download managers, as it avoids slowdowns caused by an unlucky slow Tor circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function then reads the IP address and port number of the address we’re diverting from exit_addr, a thread-safe map. The address for each process that requires the SOCKS5 proxy is saved in the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function then opens the file descriptor associated with the program’s network connection. With the os.NewFile function, the file descriptor is utilized to construct a new file object. The net.FileConn function is then called on the file object to generate a net.Conn object. This enables the application to communicate with its network connection using the standard net package rather than the lower-level system calls that were used to establish the connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NewClient function is called, as well as the client’s Dial method. This creates a new client containing details such as authentication credentials and timeout values. The Dial method is then called, which carries out the redirecting. To listen to an existing net.Conn , we are currently utilizing a customized version of SOCKS5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relevant-links&quot;&gt;Relevant Links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/txthinking/socks5&quot;&gt;SOCKS5 Repository&lt;/a&gt; We are planning to contribute the changes to the main SOCKS5 repository (Allowing the Dial Function to listen to an existing net.Conn file)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/namecoin/heteronculous-horklump&quot;&gt;Heteronculous-horklump Repository&lt;/a&gt;: The main codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robertmin1/heteronculous-horklump&quot;&gt;Temporary Heteronculous-horklump Repository&lt;/a&gt;: Contains the SOCKSification work in progress, which will be soon be merged upstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was funded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outreachy.org/&quot;&gt;Outreachy&lt;/a&gt; under the Tor Project umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Outreachy Internship Progress</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings! I wanted to provide an overall update on the project’s progress. We have successfully implemented the ability to detect the IP address and port that socket system calls are sending data to, as well as the capability to block system calls that are sending data to an IP address and port that is not the desired proxy. Additionally, we have added an option to kill the application if a proxy leak occurs, which is useful for manual QA testing, and an option to allow proxy leaks but log any that occur, which is useful for automated testing of applications. Furthermore, we have included the capability to use the environment variables that Tor Browser uses, such as TOR_SOCKS_PORT, to determine the desired proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we are currently in the process of implementing SOCKSification, which involves intercepting the connect syscall’s entry point, modifying the destination IP/Port, and capturing the established socket’s file descriptor through the exit of the connect syscall. A SOCKS5 handshake is then performed on the file descriptor. Afterwards, socks authentication enforcement and support of UDP proxies will be implemented. Socks authentication enforcement will detect if the tracee is using SOCKS without an appropriate username/password (stream isolation leak)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program instructions are manipulated using flags through &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hlandau/easyconfig/tree/v1.0.18&quot;&gt;easyconfig&lt;/a&gt; which enables easy manipulation of arguments. Logging is done using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hlandau/xlog&quot;&gt;xlog&lt;/a&gt; which provides different options for logging. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/u-root/u-root/tree/v0.10.0/pkg/strace&quot;&gt;U-root&lt;/a&gt; was preferred for tracing since it is easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestions are much welcomed! &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/namecoin/heteronculous-horklump&quot;&gt;Project Repository&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/29/introducing-intern-robert-nganga.html&quot;&gt;Project Summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
