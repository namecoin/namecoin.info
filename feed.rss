        <title>Reducing Size With Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and Name Gifting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Several new Electrum-NMC enhancements have been added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;minimizing-size-with-concise-binary-object-representation-cbor&quot;&gt;Minimizing Size with Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incorporating Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) offers significant advantages, including reduced data size and improved efficiency. Currently, to use CBOR, you need to convert your JSON data into CBOR format and paste the hex equivalent into the hex tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/screenshots/electrum-nmc/Configure-Name-Dialog-Hex-2024-05-01.png&quot; alt=&quot;Binary Encoding (value)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this process can be a bit confusing, we are working to simplify it by providing an avenue to do the conversion directly within Electrum-NMC. Once you’ve pasted the CBOR hex data, you can confirm its validity by parsing it and displaying its contents in the DNS builder dialog, by clicking the DNS Editor button, you’ll see the different records contained in the CBOR data.  Unfortunately, if you parse your CBOR hex data, you’ll need to paste it again in the hex tab, but we’re actively working to streamline this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the addition of CBOR support in ncdns, after registering a name with a CBOR encoded value, ncdns should be able to parse and provide the DNS records associated with that name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gifting-names&quot;&gt;Gifting Names&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to requesting a payment, you can now also request a name. When registering a name that is available, you’ll see an extra button and field to request someone to pay for it on your behalf. Additionally, there is an extra field where you can add an additional amount to your request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/screenshots/electrum-nmc/Buy-Name-Request-Name.png&quot; alt=&quot;Request Name (value)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After clicking the “Request Registration” button, a UI with your request will be displayed, similar to what is seen in the request tab. From there, you can send the request URL or QR code to the recipient &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(gifter)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/screenshots/electrum-nmc/Request-Name-UI-Tabs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Request Name Tabs (value)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gifter can now paste the payment URL in the receive tab or use the QR code. The details will be automatically populated, allowing the gifter to proceed with the payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/screenshots/electrum-nmc/Send-UI-Request-Name.png&quot; alt=&quot;Send Tab (value)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After your invoice is settled, you simply need to proceed with the normal name registration process. You’ll only be required to pay minimal update fees, as the name has already been paid for.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Namecoin will be at Tor Meeting 2024, GPN 22, and MoneroKon 4</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re happy to announce that Namecoin developers will be at multiple conferences over the next month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eweiibe6tdjsdprb4px6rqrzzcsi22m4koia44kc5pcjr7nec2rlxyad.onion/tpo/team/-/wikis/Meetings/2024/Lisbon&quot;&gt;Tor Meeting 2024&lt;/a&gt; in Lisbon, Portugal (May 20-24): Jeremy Rand will represent Namecoin during the main event; Jeremy Rand, Rose Turing, and Yanmaani will represent Namecoin during Community Day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://entropia.de/GPN22/en&quot;&gt;GPN 22&lt;/a&gt; in Karlsruhe, Germany (May 30 - June 2): Jeremy Rand and Rose Turing will represent Namecoin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://monerokon.org/&quot;&gt;MoneroKon 4&lt;/a&gt; in Prague, Czechia (June 7-9): Jeremy Rand, Rose Turing, and Yanmaani will represent Namecoin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, schedules are not yet finalized, but details should be posted soon on the respective conferences’ websites. (We expect to host sessions at Tor, GPN, and MoneroKon). If you’re near any of these events and would like to meet up to discuss collaboration, please ping us on #namecoin-dev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d like to thank Cyphrs, Replicant, and Cypherpunks for facilitating our participation at these conferences. See you there!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Electrum-NMC AppArmor, Static Analysis, and Input Validation + ncdns Unix Sockets</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Several new Electrum-NMC &amp;amp; ncdns enhancements have been added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;apparmor-profiles-for-electrum-nmc&quot;&gt;AppArmor Profiles for Electrum-NMC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AppArmor is a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system which confines programs to a limited set of resources. AppArmor confinement is provided via profiles loaded into the kernel.
By using AppArmor profiles, we can ensure that Electrum-NMC operates within a predefined security policy, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or malicious actions.
The profiles are provided in the contrib folder. For more information on AppArmor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/beginning-apparmor-profile-development#1-overview&quot;&gt;visit their website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;input-validation-in-electrum-nmcs-dns-builder-gui&quot;&gt;Input Validation in Electrum-NMC’s DNS Builder GUI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When passing data to the DNS Builder, certain validations are performed to offer hints and warnings about invalid data or outdated methods (such as algorithms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/screenshots/electrum-nmc/DNS-Builder-IP-Validation-2024.png&quot; alt=&quot;IP Validation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/screenshots/electrum-nmc/DNS-Builder-Algorithm-Validation-2024.png&quot; alt=&quot;IPFS Images&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;static-analysis-testing&quot;&gt;Static Analysis Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We run static analysis using tools such as Flake8, MyPy, and Pylint, comparing results with Electrum (Bitcoin version) to focus on Electrum-NMC-specific issues. This process, integrated into our CI, helps catch bugs early. Looking to contribute? Static analysis issues provide good first-time issues!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enabling-ncdns-to-perform-rpc-requests-via-unix-domain-sockets&quot;&gt;Enabling ncdns to Perform RPC Requests via Unix Domain Sockets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enabling ncdns to perform RPC requests via Unix domain sockets offers a more secure communication method than TCP/IP. To utilize a Unix domain socket, specify it in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;namecoinrpcaddress&lt;/code&gt; field as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;unix:// + &quot;your unix socket path&quot;&lt;/code&gt; such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;unix:///tmp/test.XXXX&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Namecoin Core supports only TCP/IP, we’ll redirect RPC requests from the Unix Socket to Namecoin Core. This can be achieved using a commnad such as socat command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;socat -d UNIX-LISTEN:&quot;my-unix-socket-path&quot;,fork TCP:&quot;host-address&quot;
socat -d UNIX-LISTEN:/tmp/test.XXXX,fork TCP:localhost:8332
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>rust-electrum-client for Namecoin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I needed to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/rust-electrum-client&quot;&gt;rust-electrum-client&lt;/a&gt; with Namecoin. I was kind of worried that this would be nontrivial, but as it turned out, I was able to get it working in just a few days of hacking, despite this being my first foray into Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main incompatibility that came up was that Namecoin headers have an AuxPoW header after the 80-byte Bitcoin-style header, and the deserialization functions in rust-electrum-client really didn’t like that trailing data. There were two deserialization functions that I had to patch to truncate the headers at 80 bytes, which got header parsing to work properly. My current patches are very unclean, and are not really suitable for publication, but I’m planning to clean them up and publish patches over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this was done, a few non-code workarounds were additionally needed (more on these later!), and I was then able to use a real-world rust-electrum-client application with Namecoin. I’ll talk more in a future post about what downstream code is using this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was funded by Cyphrs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Video, Slides, and Paper from Namecoin at GCER 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is a bit late, but I represented Namecoin at the 2022 Global Conference on Educational Robotics.  Although GCER doesn’t produce official recordings of their talks, I was able to obtain an amateur recording of my talk from an audience member.  I’ve also posted my slides, as well as my paper from the conference proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that, as this is an amateur recording, the audio quality is not spectacular.  It should also be noted that the audience is rather different from the audiences for whom I usually give Namecoin talks; as a result, the focus of the content is also rather different from my usual Namecoin talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;source src=&quot;https://www.namecoin.org/files/videos/gcer-2022/Namecoin-GCER-2022-720p.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/resources/presentations/GCER_2022/Namecoin_GCER_2022_Slides.pdf&quot;&gt;My slides are available here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/resources/presentations/GCER_2022/Namecoin_GCER_2022_Paper.pdf&quot;&gt;My paper is available here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to the staff and volunteers from KISS Institute for Practical Robotics, who organized GCER.  Also huge thanks to Helene Myers for the recording.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Enhancements to IPFS &amp; IPNS: A Closer Look at the Latest Updates</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Several new Electrum-NMC enhancements have been added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dedicated-gui-for-ipfs--ipns&quot;&gt;The Dedicated GUI for IPFS &amp;amp; IPNS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, interacting with IPFS required the creation of TXT records and knowledge of IPFS DNSLink. However, with the introduction of a dedicated GUI, users now have a more user-friendly option, available in the address tab. To learn more about DNSLink and its use of DNS TXT records to map names to IPFS addresses or IPNS names, refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/dnslink/&quot;&gt;IPFS DNS documentation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/screenshots/electrum-nmc/DNS-Builder-IPFS-2024-05-01.png&quot; alt=&quot;IPFS Images&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;

Demo video of Namecoin + IPFS in Brave.
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;added-option-for-value-encoding&quot;&gt;Added Option for Value Encoding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When registering names, there is now an option to pass values as binary, encoded in hexadecimal format. This enhancement provides greater flexibility and control for developers and power users, allowing them to represent domain name values in a more efficient and versatile manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/screenshots/electrum-nmc/Configure-Name-Dialog-Hex-2024-05-01.png&quot; alt=&quot;Binary Encoding (value)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gui-testing&quot;&gt;GUI Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For GUI testing, we validate the GUI form’s build process and execute regression tests, which helps us identify any errors in the files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;windows-binaries-testing&quot;&gt;Windows Binaries Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We validate the integrity of the build process and conduct regression tests on these binaries to ensure their functionality and detect any potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Namecoin will be at 37C3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After a lengthy pandemic-induced hiatus, C3 is finally back this year, and we’re happy to announce that three Namecoin developers will be at &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/wiki/index.php/Main_Page&quot;&gt;37C3 (the 37th Chaos Communication Congress)&lt;/a&gt; in Hamburg, December 27-30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excitingly, one of our developers in attendance (Hugo Landau) will be giving a talk in the main track (not a Cluster track); &lt;a href=&quot;https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2023/fahrplan/events/11781.html&quot;&gt;the details for that talk are here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect to give some additional talks and workshops at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://decentral.community/&quot;&gt;Critical Decentralization Cluster (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, however, the details of those events are still in flux and will probably not be announced until shortly before the beginning of the Congress; keep an eye on &lt;a href=&quot;https://frab.riat.at/en/37c3/public/schedule&quot;&gt;the CDC schedule&lt;/a&gt;. Recordings and live-streams may happen as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, Namecoin has participated in C3 as a Project of the Monero Assembly. We’re excited to announce that this year, Namecoin has been upgraded to a full Assembly of our own. Namecoin and Monero remain excellent friends, but everyone agreed that this year, the time was right for us to branch out as an independent Assembly. Also thanks go out to our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;https://replicant.us/&quot;&gt;The Replicant Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, who are once again facilitating Namecoin’s participation. We’re looking forward to the Congress!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Namecoin Receives 40.1k EUR in Additional Funding from NLnet Foundation’s NGI Assure Fund and European Commission</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re happy to announce that Namecoin is receiving 40,100 EUR (roughly 44,134 USD) in additional funding from &lt;a href=&quot;https://nlnet.nl/&quot;&gt;NLnet Foundation&lt;/a&gt;’s NGI Assure Fund.  If you’re unfamiliar with NLnet, you might want to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://nlnet.nl/foundation/&quot;&gt;about NLnet Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, or just take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://nlnet.nl/thema/index.html&quot;&gt;the projects they’ve funded over the years&lt;/a&gt; (you might see some familiar names).  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://nlnet.nl/assure/&quot;&gt;NGI Assure Fund&lt;/a&gt; is managed by NLnet and funded by the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, through their Next Generation Internet intitiative.  This new funding is focused on Electrum-NMC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use this funding to work on the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved sandboxing for better security.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved test coverage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved domain management GUI for better UX.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compact on-chain storage for better scalability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linux packaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work will principally be done by developers Robert Nganga and Jeremy Rand (who is the author of this post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d like to thank the awesome people at NLnet Foundation for the continued vote of confidence, as well as the European Commision for their support of a Next Generation Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be posting updates regularly as development proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Binary Encoding Support and Testing Enhancements</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Electrum-NMC has recently undergone significant improvements aimed at refining the user experience and expanding functionality. The most prominent changes involve the introduction of three distinct tabs within the graphical user interface (GUI): Hex, Domain, and ASCII. The Hex tab now serves as a dedicated space for users to interact with the hexadecimal representations of names, providing a standardized and transparent view of binary data. The Domain tab focuses on simplifying interactions by allowing users to employ a simpler format like “name.bit” instead of the original “d/name” format. Meanwhile, the ASCII tab preserves the original format of registration, ensuring compatibility for users who prefer the original format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;graceful-handling-of-invalid-ascii&quot;&gt;Graceful Handling of Invalid ASCII&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event of invalid ASCII input, the system gracefully handles the situation. This allows valid hexadecimal data that is not a valid ASCII representation to be managed without disrupting the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;appimage-binaries-testing&quot;&gt;AppImage Binaries Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dedicated testing pipeline has been introduced for AppImage binaries. The regression tests run on these binaries to verify their functionality and identify any potential issues. This meticulous approach ensures that users working with AppImage binaries can trust in the stability and performance of Electrum-NMC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;macos-tarball-binaries-testing&quot;&gt;MacOS Tarball Binaries Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For MacOS, a specific testing environment has been created to run regression tests on the tarball binaries. This testing setup not only verifies the integrity of the binaries but also ensures that Electrum-NMC performs seamlessly in a MacOS environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These testing procedures cover a range of scenarios and use cases, providing a robust framework to identify and address any potential issues before they impact end-users. The commitment to thorough testing underscores the project’s dedication to delivering a reliable and high-performance cryptocurrency wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was funded by NLnet Foundation’s NGI Assure Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
